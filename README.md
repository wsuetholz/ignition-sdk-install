Ignition SDK Import
===================

This is a little helper that imports the Ignition(R) API into your local Maven repository.

- Download the API
- Set the api-path (local path to the extracted API) and api-version (e.g. '7.6.4') properties in the pom.
- Run 'Install SDK' to install the SDK to the local maven repository
